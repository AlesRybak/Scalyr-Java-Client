Here is the source code to the Scalyr client library. We provide this code for
several reasons:

1. So that engineers who really like to understand how things work, can see
the inner workings.

2. To aid in debugging code that invokes the Scalyr client.

3. As sample code for using Scalyr services from a language for which we have
not yet developed an official client.

Note that as of this writing, no license is attached to this source code. We
do plan to attach an open-source license in the near future. We do not
actively solicit outside contributions to the client library, but if you'd
like to submit a patch, feel free to get in touch (contact@scalyr.com).
